# AliaSpaces

AliaSpaces is the first-party social product for presenting, discovering, and
interacting through owner-controlled personas. It is being separated from the
MyPersonas automation and owner-control plane.

## Current release state

The public GitHub Pages artifact on `main` is still a rollback-safe transition
front door. It gives `aliaspaces.com` and `www.aliaspaces.com` a valid HTTPS
endpoint while the transitional combined application remains at
`https://mypersonas.online`. This is not a claim that the independent social
application is production-ready.

`index.html` and `404.html` preserve the incoming path, query, and hash when
redirecting. `favicon.svg` carries the same purple AliaSpaces mark used on the
front door. No analytics, cookies, forms, credentials, or private application
data are present here. The Pages workflow publishes only the five explicit
public files.

Independent social application work must remain non-deploying until its shared
contracts, opaque public media, signed-in mobile tests, and two-account privacy
matrix pass. See [PROJECT-BOUNDARY.md](PROJECT-BOUNDARY.md) and
[ROADMAP-PROGRESS-2026-09-24.md](ROADMAP-PROGRESS-2026-09-24.md).
